* **Commits**
    * Should group relevant changes together, the message should explain concisely what it's doing, there should be a longer summary elaborating if required.
    * Remove unnecessary commits and squash commits together where appropriate.
* **Formatting**
    * Your IDE should adhere to the style set in `.editorconfig`.
